            Devlog #2 marks a major step forward for the T.R.U.S.T. demo. 
            The storyline has now been fully integrated into gameplay, allowing the narrative to unfold naturally 
            as players explore the maze. Instead of feeling separate from the experience, the story now lives 
            inside the mechanics.
            Alongside that, we implemented multiple new UI systems to strengthen immersion, clarity, and tension.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 tracking-wide">What’s New in the Demo</h2>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 tracking-wide">Interaction & Objectives System</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Players now have a dedicated interaction panel that appears when engaging with objects. 
            We also added an Objectives Menu (accessible by pressing “O”) so players can track their progress 
            as they move through the maze. These systems reduce confusion while preserving psychological tension.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 tracking-wide">Sanity System</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The sanity bar is now fully implemented. Answering phones throughout the level lowers the player’s sanity, 
            reinforcing the idea that interaction comes at a cost. As the player obeys the voice, their perception begins to shift.
            Progression is no longer just physical — it’s mental.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 tracking-wide">Progression Mechanics</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The keypad now appears only after every phone has been answered. 
            This ties narrative obedience directly to gameplay progression. 
            Players must decide whether continuing to answer the calls is worth the psychological toll.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 tracking-wide">UI & Visual Additions</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We added subtitles for dialogue, an instruction panel, a redesigned pause menu (bug fixed), 
            a loading screen, splash screen, and a demo “Thank You” screen. 
            These additions give the demo a more cohesive and polished identity.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 tracking-wide">What’s Next</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The next phase of development focuses on immersion. 
            We’ll be recording voice lines, implementing environmental sound design, 
            adding floor textures to deepen atmosphere, and placing rosaries randomly throughout the maze 
            to strengthen environmental storytelling.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We’re still learning as first-time developers, but every system we build pushes T.R.U.S.T. 
            closer to becoming the psychological experience we envisioned.
