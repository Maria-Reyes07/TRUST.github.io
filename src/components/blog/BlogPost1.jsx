            We're thrilled to share our first major development update for T.R.U.S.T. (The Reality Until Sight Transform). 
            It has been almost a year now, and this journey has been very much like a roller coaster.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 tracking-wide">What We've Been Working On</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 tracking-wide">Core Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The foundation of T.R.U.S.T. revolves around perception and reality distortion. 
            We've implemented a unique system where the player's choices and mental state directly affect how they perceive the game world. 
            What you see might not always be what's really there.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 tracking-wide">Visual Effects System</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Our custom screen-shake and distortion system creates the fear the characters feel in the moment, 
            keeping the player on edge. Seeing doubles, not knowing the difference between reality and the character's mental state.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 tracking-wide">Environmental Storytelling</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Every location in T.R.U.S.T. tells its own story. We’re designing environments that feel both lived-in and abandoned, filled with subtle clues that reflect the inner 
            struggles many Christians face—battling doubts, fears, and the mind’s illusions. Players will constantly question what’s real and what’s imagined, mirroring that 
            journey of discernment.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 tracking-wide">What's Next</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We're currently working on the game's demo. We have the first floor set up and ready. We are working on the character design of the main characters. 
            The enemies are already drawn out, and now they will be turned into 3D. This is our first time designing a video game, so we are also learning as we go.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            At first, we were going to use Unreal to build our game, but it kept crashing, so we moved to Godot. We had to learn the hard way that Unreal is not laptop-friendly. 
            Unreal probably works better with PCs.
          </p>
